name: worker-management
description: Use when admin requests hand-creating or resetting a Worker, starting/stopping a Worker, managing Worker skills, enabling peer mentions, or opening a CoPaw console. Use hiclaw-find-worker only as a helper for Nacos-backed market import or when task assignment needs you to discover a suitable Worker.

# Worker Management

## Quick Create (2 steps)

```bash
# 1. Write SOUL.md (REQUIRED)
mkdir -p /root/hiclaw-fs/agents/<NAME>
# Write SOUL.md with AI Identity + Role + Security sections (see references/create-worker.md)

# 2. Run create script
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-management/scripts/create-worker.sh \
  --name <NAME> --skills <skill1>,<skill2>
# Omit --runtime to use the default Worker runtime (now CoPaw)
# Add --remote for admin-managed deployment
```

> Full creation workflow (runtime selection, SOUL.md template, skill matching, post-creation greeting): read `references/create-worker.md`

## Gotchas

- **Worker name must be lowercase and > 3 characters** — Tuwunel stores usernames in lowercase; short names cause registration failures
- **`--remote` means "remote from Manager"** — which is actually LOCAL from the admin's perspective. Use it when admin says "local mode" / "run on my machine"
- **`file-sync`, `task-progress`, `project-participation` are default skills** — always included, cannot be removed
- **Use `hiclaw-find-worker` only for Nacos-backed market imports or Worker discovery during task assignment** — generic Worker creation and lifecycle changes stay in this skill
- **Peer mentions cause loops if not briefed** — after enabling, explicitly tell Workers to only @mention peers for blocking info, never for acknowledgments
- **Always notify Workers to `file-sync` after writing files they need** — the 5-minute periodic sync is fallback only
- **Workers are stateless** — all state is in centralized storage. Reset = recreate config files
- **Matrix accounts persist in Tuwunel** (cannot be deleted via API) — reuse same username on reset

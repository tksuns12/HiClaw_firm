# Worker Model Switch

Switch a Worker's LLM model. The script tests connectivity first, then patches the Worker's `openclaw.json` in MinIO and notifies the Worker.

## Usage

```bash
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-model-switch/scripts/update-worker-model.sh \
  --worker <WORKER_NAME> --model <MODEL_ID> [--context-window <SIZE>] [--no-reasoning]
```

Examples:
```bash
bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-model-switch/scripts/update-worker-model.sh \
  --worker alice --model claude-sonnet-4-6

bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-model-switch/scripts/update-worker-model.sh \
  --worker alice --model my-custom-model --context-window 300000

bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-model-switch/scripts/update-worker-model.sh \
  --worker alice --model deepseek-chat --no-reasoning
```

## What the script does

1. Strips any `hiclaw-gateway/` prefix from the model name
2. Tests the model via `POST /v1/chat/completions` on the AI Gateway — exits with error if unreachable
3. Pulls the Worker's `openclaw.json` from MinIO
4. If the model is already in the `models` array: switches `agents.defaults.model.primary`
5. If the model is new: adds it to the `models` array and switches primary
6. Pushes the updated `openclaw.json` back to MinIO
7. Updates `workers-registry.json` with the new model name
8. Sends a Matrix @mention to the Worker asking it to file-sync and restart
9. Always outputs `RESTART_REQUIRED`

## After running the script

The script always outputs `RESTART_REQUIRED`. You must recreate the Worker container for the change to take effect. Ask the human admin: **"The model config has been updated. Would you like me to recreate the Worker now?"**

## Reasoning control

By default, reasoning (extended thinking) is enabled. To disable it, pass `--no-reasoning`.

If the Worker container is stopped, the config is still updated in MinIO — it will take effect on next start.

## On failure

If the gateway test fails (non-200), the script outputs `ERROR: MODEL_NOT_REACHABLE` and exits. No changes are made to `openclaw.json`.

When you see this error, tell the human admin clearly:

1. The model is not reachable because the current default AI Provider likely does not support it.
2. They need to open the Higress Console and:
   - Create a **new AI Provider** for the model's vendor (e.g. `kimi`, `deepseek`, `minimax`).
   - Create a **new AI Route** with a model name prefix predicate (e.g. provider `kimi` → match `kimi-*`), so that requests for models with that prefix are routed to the new provider, while unmatched models continue to go through the default route.
3. **Do NOT modify the default AI Provider** — it is managed by the initialization config and will be overwritten on restart.

After the admin confirms the provider and route are configured, you can retry the model-switch script.

## Important

This skill switches the Worker's **primary model** (persisted in `openclaw.json` in MinIO). After running the script, the Worker container must be restarted (recreated) for the change to take effect. The human admin can also use `@worker /model <model>` to switch the current session's model instantly without restart, but that is non-persistent and only supports pre-configured models.

## Switching to an unknown model

When the human admin requests switching a Worker to a model you don't recognize, you MUST:

1. **Ask the admin two questions** before running the script:
   - "This model is not in the known list. What is its context window size (in tokens)?"
   - "Does this model support reasoning (extended thinking)?"
2. Run the script with the appropriate flags:
   ```bash
   bash /opt/hiclaw/agent/skills/worker-model-switch/scripts/update-worker-model.sh \
     --worker <WORKER_NAME> --model <MODEL_ID> --context-window <SIZE> [--no-reasoning]
   ```
3. If the admin does not know the context window, use the default (150,000) by omitting `--context-window`.
4. If the model does not support reasoning, add `--no-reasoning`.
